# Neural-Networks
<br>

##What is this?

This repository is a collection of sorted neural networks. It is licensed under the apache 2.0 licence, so use the networks freely, but to redistribute you must make major edits and mension them. 
<br>

##How do I use these?

The models given are tensorflow models. In each neural network, you will find a folder named FullModel. That folder is the tensorflow model. You will also find a readme.txt, instructing how to use the model in detail, and a Test Code.py. The Test Code.py allows you to test the network. You need to have python installed to run it and also get the dependencies mentioned in the readme.txt via pip. Take help from the Test Code.py to implement the neural networks in your own project.

##Specifications

The models were trained on an intel I7 7th generation AVX2 processor. Number of samples and epochs are different for each network and are mensioned in the readme.txt of each network. Type of neural network is also mensioned in the same. Activation function of the networks is relu.
